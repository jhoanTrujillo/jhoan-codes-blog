# Jhoan Codes - The Blog

A blog where I share insights, my personal experience, and tips about web development. The blog is a safe space for others to share comments, see post, interact with a community throught our post. 

> Blog built using Django, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

Deployed in **Heroku**: [Link to APP](https://jhoancodes-blog-974ca7dbd7b0.herokuapp.com/)

## UX/UI Design
In this section, we cover the initial project design ideas, the user experience/design, UI choices, wireframing, and the user stories.

### UX
#### Initial Ideal
The decision to create a blog stemmed from my desire to establish a space where I can share my knowledge, experiences, and journey in the world of web development with others. Additionally, since the Django framework is designed specifically for blog/news creation, I felt it would be fitting to test its capabilities by focusing on its specialized use case.

#### User Stories 
All user stories & epics can be find in the [Project board](https://github.com/users/jhoanTrujillo/projects/4)

#### Feature List
There were many features I wanted to implement in the blog. However, due to time constraints, I decided to prioritize the main features essential for a functioning blog. To allow room for future features and to adhere to a proper agile process, I included all desired features in the list, although not all were ultimately implemented. This was due to time constraints sadly.

To see the list of features and their current state, please see the [Project board](https://github.com/users/jhoanTrujillo/projects/4).

### UI
#### Wireframe & Framework
THe wireframe was easy. Since it is a personal project, I was able to just go with my own sense of style and aesthetic, also, bulma makes styling so easy, that designing for desktop was a great alternative, as the framework is design with mobile in mind by default, so all the elements/styling choices, default to a nice mobile viewport display.

#### Fonts
**Roboto/Bold**: The font is simple, clear, and easy to read. Additionally, the roundest of the font make it somehow approachable or friendly. This should create a welcoming/inviting experience.
**DM Sans/Regular**: I decided to this font in combination with Roboto to create a good contrast. DM Sans is also a highly readable font, but the difference in weight should provide a good contrast to ensure a proper visual hierarchy.

#### Color Scheme 
I wanted a light and energetic color palette that would compliment the selection of fonts.

- hsl(48, 100%, 67%)/#ffdd57 **Yellow** inspired by the [Bulma CSS palette](https://bulma.io/documentation/helpers/color-helpers/)  since the color is well balanced with white and black to create good contrast. It also helps highlight important elements in the site, such as titles, and divide certain page elements. 
- hsl(0, 100%, 100%)/#ffffff **White** is a color I consider to be classic web styling. Also, it is easy to contrast when using fonts that use shades of black and dark grey. 
- hsl(0, 0%, 21%)/#363636 **Dark gray** this shade of black/grey was selected as it softens the impact of the color black on the eyes, when in contrast with colors such as white and yellow.

## Database Design
Although there are several models created for the project, some of them are handled by apps and Django packages. For example, superuser/admin access is managed by Django backend functionality, while visitor/user access and registration are handled by AllAuth. Therefore, the databases used for these specific cases won't be added to the section below.

Regarding the database, we have some basic models such as Post and Comments, which complement each other and communicate via a Foreign Key relationship, or Many-to-One. Since several comments are associated with one post, and several posts can be connected to a single user, but as mentioned before, the users won't be displayed here, as Django has a module that handles that for us.

Now, the profile is interesting because it requires the use of signals and the creation of a profile model. This model connects on a One-to-One basis with a User, meaning one user can only have one profile and vice versa. However, the signals were needed to enable the creation of a new profile when a user is created.

## Technologies & Deployment

#### Technologies used 

The technologies used to built this blog were:

- **Python/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)**: The main technology used to implement the MVC, create the database, and render the views for the project.   
- **HTML**: To handle markup.
- **CSS/[Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/)**: CSS + the Bulma CSS framework. Amazing modern CSS framework. 
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks were used for this project. 
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.

**Workspace & Tools**
- **VS code**: This is my default text editor to work on programming projects. 
- **ElephantSQL**: A PostgreSQL database hosting service. Their free plan makes it convenient for small portfolio projects such as this. 
- [**Diagram.io**](https://app.diagrams.net/): Free diagram making tool online.
- [**Remove.bg**](https://www.remove.bg/): Website that removes images background with the help of AI. The free plan returns a lower quality image, but they are still usable.
- Cloudinary: a cloudbased media servicing site that offers a free plan. 

### Clone Repo
To clone this project you just need to use the link in the github repo. Once in your desired folder run the command:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Once that is done, you might need to setup postgreSQL server to add the database to your project. For that, 

 of the site. Additionally, once the site is in place, you can use your terminal, ensure you are in the same folder, and in the command line type:



### Deployment

coming soon

## Testing
In the area below I break down all the testing done on the website. Code format, Color contrast, Font Readability, Manual testing, All is handle in the section below. 

### Color
Testing done using the [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). The main colors that the block uses for content pass the accessibility test.

![white background against black font - accessibility test](repo/media/bg-white_vs_fg-black.png)
![yellow background against black font - accessibility test](repo/media/fg-black_vs_bg-yellow.png)

The color palette was selected for it's simplicity, approachability, and ease of use. In the test we can notice how the colors match perfectly to bring a full accessibly experience, and to ensure most readers have a easy time using the site.

### Python CI Linter
Using the [CI python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) I noticed the majority of .py files created had small indentation issues, so I was able to correct the issues. It wasn't too time consuming, since there wasn't any major error or syntactical problem. It was mostly a matter of indentation and spaces. Here are some test:

**Models.py - test**

- ![](repo/media/models.py.png)

**Signals.py - test**

- ![](repo/media/Signals.py.png)

This specific test provided little to no proble, or time consumption since the process is mostly handle by the linter, and the corrections are simple indentation/white space removal. At least in my case. 

### W3 HTML Validator test

This test was a bit more lenghty as there were certain small issues that came up as the project became bigger and started using more HTML. Mostly, it came down to missplaced single tags, leaving trailing closing **/** slashes, and adding unnecessary aria labels in certain elements. 

The issues I found weren't huge, or store breaking since plenty of manual test was done before the W3 testing. But there was a lot to correct when it came down to good practices and code tidiness. 

On a side note, the signup page seems to be having some issues with [W3 HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjhoancodes-blog-974ca7dbd7b0.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Fsignup%2F#l108c60) due to the nature of the autogenerated forms. It seems to be a minor issue, but a issue non the less.

### Manual Testing
Bulma CSS, is an amazing framework and it played an amazing part on making my project as responsive as possible. Of course, there were sections where I had to use CSS to correct and change minor responsiveness details, but overall the project adapts nicely to different screen sizes. 

Below I would like to share a couple of videos navigating the site, in an late stage in different viewports:

###Â BUGS!!

For this project personal circumstances made it so I wasn't able to use all the time I had a hand, in fact, This project was built in four day! which is not the best timeframe to built a robust blogging solution with not much backend experience, as such, I decided to hunt for as many bugs as possible to work on the improvement of the platform in the long term. 

Consider this version, a MVP, which sets out to do it's job. Provide a basic blogging experience with some extra community building features. 

- In my search, I found and fixed a couple of bugs but there are many that
