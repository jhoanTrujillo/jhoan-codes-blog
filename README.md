## UX/UI Design
In this section, we cover the initial project design ideas, the user experience/design, UI choices, wireframing, and the user stories.

### UX

#### Initial Ideal
The decision to create a blog stemmed from my desire to establish a space where I can share my knowledge, experiences, and journey in the world of web development with others. Additionally, since the Django framework is designed specifically for blog/news creation, I felt it would be fitting to test its capabilities by focusing on its specialized use case.

#### User Stories 
All user stories can be find in the [Project board](https://github.com/users/jhoanTrujillo/projects/4)

#### Feature List
There were many features I wanted to implement in the blog. However, due to time constraints, I decided to prioritize the main features essential for a functioning blog. To allow room for future features and to adhere to a proper agile process, I included all desired features in the list, although not all were ultimately implemented.

### UI

#### Wireframe & Framework

#### Fonts
**Roboto/Bold**: The font is simple, clear, and easy to read. Additionally, the roundest of the font make it somehow approachable or friendly. This should create a welcoming/inviting experience.
**DM Sans/Regular**: I decided to this font in combination with Roboto to create a good contrast. DM Sans is also a highly readable font, but the difference in weight should provide a good contrast to ensure a proper visual hierarchy.

#### Color Scheme

## Technologies & Deployment

#### Technologies used 

The technologies used to built this blog were:

- **Python/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)**: The main technology used to implement the MVC, create the database, and render the views for the project.   
- **HTML**: To handle markup.
- **CSS/[Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)**: CSS. but Mostly via the framework materialized CSS. The framework helps materialize the development speed, by providing useful pre-built element styling. 
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks were used for this project. 
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.

**Workspace & Tools**
- **VS code**: This is my default text editor to work on programming projects. 
- **ElephantSQL**: A PostgreSQL database hosting service. Their free plan makes it convenient for small portfolio projects such as this. 
- [**Diagram.io**](https://app.diagrams.net/): Free diagram making tool online.
